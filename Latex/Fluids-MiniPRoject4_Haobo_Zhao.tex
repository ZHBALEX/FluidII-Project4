\section{Question Review}

Using the Prandtl lifting line theory, calculate the aerodynamic coefficients of a wing for which aerodynamic data are available. The wing's geometry to be studied is illustrated in the figure below. The wing, which is unswept at the quarter chord, is composed of NACA 65-210 airfoil sections. The zero-lift angle of attack $(\alpha_{L=0})$ is approximately $-1.2$ across the span. Since the wing is untwisted, the geometric angle of attack is the same at all spanwise positions. The aspect ratio (AR) is $9.00$. The taper ratio $\lambda$ (i.e., $C_t/C_r$) is $0.40$. The wing planform is trapezoidal, as seen in the figure below.

Next, model this problem in Fluent (inviscid flow) and obtain the aerodynamic coefficients of the wing. Compare the results from the two methods (analytical, Fluent).

\section{Result Based on Prandtl Lifting Line Theory}

\subsection{Prandtl Lifting Line Theory}
Based on Prnadtl lifting theory, the formula we could get as follows:
$$
\alpha(\theta_0) = \frac{2b}{\pi C(\theta_0)} \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \sin(n \theta_0) + \alpha_{L=0}(\theta_0) + \sum_{n=1}^{N} n A_n \frac{\sin n \theta}{\sin \theta_0}
$$

To get $An$, we need to build a matrix equation based on different $\theta_0$. As $\theta_0$ is based on $y$, which is showing below:
$$
y = \frac{b}{2} \cos \theta
$$

We could choose \# N different $y$ or $\theta_0$ among the wing, could get \# N of An, which means we are building an $N \times N$ matrix:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ \frac{2b}{\pi C(\theta_0)} \sin(n \theta_0) + n \frac{\sin(n \theta_0)}{\sin(\theta_0)} \right] A_n = \alpha(\theta_0) - \alpha_{L=0}(\theta_0)
$$

Where, $An$ is variable, and $ \frac{2b}{\pi C(\theta_0)} \sin(n \theta_0) + n \frac{\sin(n \theta_0)}{\sin(\theta_0)}$ is the coefficient for each $An$. As the wing is untwisted, $\alpha_{L=0}(\theta_0)$ is same among different $y$.\\

Then, we could use \# N $y$ to find \# N $\theta_0$, and then find \# N $An$.\\



After we find $An$, we could calculate $C_l$ and $C_{Di}$ based on the following formula:
$$
C_L = A_1 \pi \frac{b^2}{s} = A_1 \pi AR
$$

and 

$$
C_{D_i} = \pi AR \left( A_1^2 +  \sum_{n=1}^{N} n A_n^2 \right)
$$

\section{ANSYS Modeling for 3D-Wing}


\subsection{3D Modeling and Boundary setting}

By getting NACA-65-210 airfoil from website, we could create the 3D-model based on the diagram showned in the question.\\

We could get 3D model as follows:
% Picture:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Homeworks/fluids-MinProject4/Latex/figure/3D-Model.png}
    \label{IGs.jpg}
    \caption{3D model}
\end{figure}






After we got the 3D geometry of the calculation domain, we need to set the boundaries:

    \label{IGs.jpg}
    \caption{2D boundary define}
\end{figure}

This is our model in 2D-view, from which we can find there is 4 kind of boundaries: Inlet, outlet, airfoil, and outside:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inlet: air velocity inlet, $v_in = 1m/s$
    \item Outlet: air outlet, $p=0$
    \item Airfoil: slip airfoil, as viscosity is 0
    \item Outside: outer boundary, symmetric
\end{itemize}
